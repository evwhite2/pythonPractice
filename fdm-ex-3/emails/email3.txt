Subject Line: Following up on my call

Hi John,

I called you late last week in response to your recent download of the ThriveHive Marketing Guide. I have attached it here in case you had any difficulties accessing it.

I am also sending you our AdWords for Small Business Guide to address some of the questions you had last week. I hope you will find it helpful and informative. Please feel free to let me know if you had any questions or feedback.

If you are currently looking for better ways to continue to market your business and generate leads, I believe that ThriveHive may be a great solution for you and here is why:
